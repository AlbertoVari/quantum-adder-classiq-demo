# quantum-adder-classiq-demo
A minimal quantum adder demo built using the Classiq SDK.
This project demonstrates a simple 1-qubit XOR-based quantum addition using Classiq’s high-level circuit modeling approach. It is intended as a showcase of freelance capabilities in quantum software prototyping, and how Classiq can be used to rapidly design and visualize circuits.

🔧 Tech Stack:

Python

Classiq SDK

📦 Features:

Quantum function defined with @qfunc

Bit allocation and simple logic operations

Circuit synthesis and visualization via Classiq tools

📍 This repository is part of a freelance proposal for quantum software collaboration.
